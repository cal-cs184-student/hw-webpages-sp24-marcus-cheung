		De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive algorithm for computing the position of a point on a Bezier curve. Given n control points, we iteratively recurse and perform linear interpolations between points evaluating on some fractional length parameter t until we find the point parametrized on t. Doing this across different t values will yield our Bezier curve. To implement this algorithm, I make a helper function EvaluteStep() which will perform a single step of the interpolation on the control points parameterized on fixed value t. By iteratively calling this function I can recurse through the steps until convergence. Below is an example of this process using 6 control points.

		The de Casteljau algorithm can be used for Bezier surfaces by defining the surfaces as the surface created by sliding a curve parametrized on u and v. Thus we can define a surface with a grid of control points and interpolate across the sub grids using the algorithm and use this to evaluate the surface. To implement this I begin with a similar helper function to part 1 but one that operates on 3D vectors. With this single iteration evaluateStep(), I can create a higher level helper function that evaluates a point on the curve on some param t called evaluate1D. This is finally called by the evaluate() function which evaluates a Bezier path parameterized on (u, v).

		To implement area-weighted vertex normals, I simply loop through half edges in such a way to traverse across the mesh faces surrounding a given vertex. As I iterate through, I sum the normal vector weighted by the area of the face computed by taking half the cross product between two vectors between the face defining vertices. Finally I normalize this summed 3D vector to produce my unit normal vector. Below we can see this operation in action for Phong shading.

		To implement the edge-flip, I begin by declaring all pointers associated with my starting edge (half edges, vertices, edges, faces). Then follows a series of complicated pointer reassignments that I figured out by manually writing out all reassignments that should occur for each element in the mesh. One small mistake I made was while writing out all the pointers, I mistakenly named one of the edges e0 which broke the code since we should not overwrite this variable. Below you can see some instances of edge flipping on the teapot mesh.

		To implement edge-splitting, I began with a similar process to part 4 by writing out all reassignments and new mesh elements. Firstly I check if I am on a boundary edge, then effectively abort since this edge is not splittable. Otherwise, the algorithm begins by declaring all the pointers associated with the splitting edge. I then instantiate new mesh elements to be added in which consists of 6 half edges, 3 edges, one new midpoint vertice, and 2 faces. I then reassign all the pointers in a similar fashion to part 4 ensuring I correctly flag them as new elements when appropriate which would later be essential for loop subdivision to work properly.

		To implement loop subdivision, I followed the given pseudo code step by step. Firstly, I iterated through the edges and recomputed new positions for every vertex. I do this by finding relative vertices A, B, C, D to the edge and computing 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D) and saving it to the edge “newPosition” instance variable. I did make a small mistake in this step by incorrectly getting the pointer to vertex D which resulted in strange blob like asymmetries as I ran the sub division up sampling. Then I compute updated positions for all old vertices following the (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum formula and iterating across all mesh vertices. Then I split the edges making sure that it only gets split over original edges. Next I flip over edges between new and old vertices. One issue I ran into here that took a while to debug was the fact that this operation should only be done on new edges. Without this condition check, I ended up flipping when I shouldn’t have and created strange artifacts. Finally I update the vertex positions by setting its position to be the saved newPosition. As we run the algorithm sharp corners and edges seem to smooth out and become round. In meshes such as cube.dae, asymmetries in the beginning edge formation result in a very not cubelike shape as we upsample. To mitigate this we can perform some splits to create a more symmetric edge structure on the cube. With this preprocessing, as we upsample, the cube appears to subdivide more symmetrically. This is likely because as we upsample, we end up with non-uniform subdivisions for a non uniform starting topology, which propagate into asymmetries after full evaluation. Pre splitting will increase the starting uniformity and thus allow our subdivisions to be more uniform, then allowing us to maintain our original structure as the mesh rounds out. See the images below to see this in action.
